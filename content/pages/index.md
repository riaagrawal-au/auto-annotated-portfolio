      Hi Po!
    subtitle: >-
      Can't believe it's already been 31 days with you (well, to be fair, 184 days since we've started dating, but apparently those first 5 months don't count according to your Math)! Anyway, I tried my hand at building you this little website to celebrate our first official month together, which involved a lot of coding, vibe coding, some light crying, and a lot more blood than I was expecting. I hope you like it and pretend not to notice the sections that are broken because I genuinely have no idea how to fix them anymore.
