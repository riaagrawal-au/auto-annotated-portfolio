Po,

I think I often forget to thank you for the small things. It’s not on purpose, I get caught up in the silly semantics of getting by every day. 

I just wanted to let you know that I see every one of those small things that you do for me. I see the massages you employ when my headaches won’t quit. The way you reach for my bags before I can ask. The mornings you knock on my door to pull me back into my routine. The cheese you brought on our first date, and keep bringing, on hard days and good ones alike. The metro tickets you buy for both of us ahead of time. The afternoons you help me clean when the room (and my mind) feels like too much. The way you learned to make eggs benedict even though you don’t like eggs. The little website you built so we could count down to our next call. The patience you show when I stretch our walks for just ten more minutes, that admittedly often turns into an hour. 

This quiet, unspoken care underlies everything you do, which makes me feel so seen and loved.

There’s this moment that’s stuck with me, the evening after your birthday party. We were sitting in your room, waiting to go back to campus. The sunset had lit your entire room up, and A Thousand Years was playing faintly from your parents’ bedroom. It was one of those moments where everything just clicked. You looked at me, and in that quiet, I felt this rush of warmth, and you felt like home.

At the end of every day, when the screen turns to black and we're back on campus (or back in AWHO Sujjan Vihar A605), brushing our teeth, playing Overcooked, cuddling under the blanket, watching New Girl, making breakfast — I realise just how lucky I am to share my days with you. You make my life lighter, fuller, more human.

I was going to tell you this last night, but between coming back to campus from Hashery, and the Glucon-D sugar rush, it got a bit too late. And now you’re here, sitting across from me with your legs folded, showing up for me, like you always do.

Also, I don't want to hear it — sloppy penmanship, shit splleing. I don't write often, and neither am I an English-CW major, so bear with me here.

Love,
Ria
